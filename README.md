# Sleep Calculator made by Daniel Mace
### Description:
This is a sleep calculator made for the media project for CHS Comp 1. This is a simple caluclator that takes in when you want to go to bed or when you want to wake up and tells you how and when you should sleep to optimize finishing REM Sleep cycles. The second page has a description of why sleep matters and how it affects teens (related to my writing this semester).
